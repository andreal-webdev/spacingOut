    It is composed mostly of hydrogen and helium and generates energy through a process called nuclear fusion. The Sun's gravitational pull keeps all the planets in orbit.",//
    
    "Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun and experiences extreme temperature variations. Despite its proximity to the Sun, it has a very thin atmosphere and is heavily cratered,\
    resembling Earth's Moon. A day on Mercury is longer than its year.",

    "Venus is often called Earth's 'sister planet' due to its similar size and mass. It has a thick atmosphere, \
    mostly composed of carbon dioxide, causing a runaway greenhouse effect. Venus rotates on its axis very slowly, and a day on Venus is longer than its year.", 

    "Earth is the only known planet to support life, with a diverse range of ecosystems and climates. It has a protective atmosphere and a magnetic field that shields it from harmful solar radiation. \
    Earth's rotation gives rise to day and night, and its axial tilt causes seasons.",

    "Mars is known as the 'Red Planet' due to its rusty, iron-rich soil. \
    It has the tallest volcano and the deepest canyon in the solar system. NASA's rovers have been exploring its surface for signs of past life.",

    "Jupiter is the largest planet, with a strong magnetic field and an iconic Great Red Spotâ€”a giant storm. It has over 75 known moons,\
    including the four Galilean moons: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto.",

    "Saturn is famous for its stunning ring system, composed of ice and rock particles. \
    It has the second-largest moon in the solar system, Titan, with an atmosphere and lakes of liquid methane.",

    "Uranus rotates on its side, likely due to a collision early in its history. It has a pale blue-green color due to the presence of methane in its atmosphere.",

    "Neptune is the farthest known planet from the Sun and has strong winds and a dynamic atmosphere. It has a dark storm system called the Great Dark Spot, similar to Jupiter's Great Red Spot."],  // Replace with your additional information
